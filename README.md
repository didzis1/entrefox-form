# EntreFox Survey Form

The main project goal is to recreate and redesign a development discussion survey for EntreFox. This survey will be integrated in EntreFox's website, which will replace the old survey made with webropol. The necessary features include a survey with EntreFox's theme as well as more detailed summary at the end of the survey. The objective was to make this project as reusable as possible since it will be used for more than one survey on EntreFox's website.
